<h1>The definition of a PhD</h1>
  <p>    The PhD can take on something of a mythic status. Are they only for geniuses? Do you have to discover something incredible? Does the qualification make you an academic? And are higher research degrees just for people who want to be academics?
    
    Even the full title, ‘Doctor of Philosophy’, has a somewhat mysterious ring to it. Do you become a doctor? Yes, but not that kind of doctor. Do you have to study Philosophy? No (not unless you want to).
    
    So, before going any further, let's explain what the term 'PhD' actually means and what defines a doctorate.</p>

    <p>
        <h1>What does PhD stand for?</h1>
PhD stands for Doctor of Philosophy. This is one of the highest level academic degrees that can be awarded.
 PhD is an abbreviation of the Latin term (Ph)ilosophiae (D)octor. Traditionally the term ‘philosophy’ does not refer to the subject but its original Greek meaning which roughly translates to ‘lover of wisdom’.
